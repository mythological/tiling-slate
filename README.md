# tiling-slate

Turn Slate into a tiling window manager for OSX. 

See my [blog](http://solstice.me/osx-tiling-workflow) for more details. 

## Setup

If you are already using Slate, just run the following commands in your terminal:

    git clone git@github.com:mythological/tiling-slate;
    ls -la ~/ | grep -q .slate.js && cp ~/.slate.js ~/.slate.js.orig
    ls -la ~/ | grep -1 .slate && cp ~/.slate ~/.slate.orig
    cp tiling-slate/slate.js ~/.slate.js
    rm -rf tiling-slate

Otherwise, just copy the following command into your terminal:

    git clone git@github.com:mythological/tiling-slate && cp tiling-slate/slate.js ~/.slate.js && rm -rf tiling-slate

At that point just open up your Slate menu as shown in the following screen shot

and then select "Relaunch" and load config.

## Usage
To switch window layouts, just use the following key combination:

    control+command+space

You can also switch focus between windows by using these key combos:

    // switch focus up
    control+command+k

    // switch focus down
    control+command+j

    // switch focus right
    control+command+l

    // switch focus left
    control+command+h

These keystrokes should seem familiar if youâ€™re a vim user.
